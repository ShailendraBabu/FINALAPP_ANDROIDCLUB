# FINALAPP_ANDROIDCLUB

This is my final app for android club VIT Chennai.

This is a to do list app that can store daily activities and eventually delete them after completion.

This app would be very useful to people who want to make a note of their tasks daily

A demo of the app is given below -

First we give the task to be done at a specific instant of time as an input in the input section available at the homescreen.
Then this input is stored as a task in the tasks to do section of the app. 
Once the task is done it must be deleted using the delete button provided in the tasks to do section of the app.
This app is done using the redux technique.
This app can be used as a reminder app and as a to do list app as well
